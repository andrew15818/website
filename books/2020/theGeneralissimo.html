				<h3>Why read this book?</h3>
				<p>I was roaming the school library one day when I 
					stumbled on this one. I'd heard the story of Chiang Kai-Shek in school, about 
					how he was the leader of the Republic of China, lost to the CCP and retreated to 
					Taiwan; but I did not really know much about what he did on the island or how he 
					rose to power in the first place. Also, since opinions of him in Taiwan are 
					a mixed, I wanted to know for myself what he was all about. The war years and the 
					struggle between the KMT and CCP were especially fascinating to me. 	
				</p>
				<p>
					The life of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiang_Kai-shek">Chiang Kai Shek</a>
					continues to be quite controversial. Common phrases associated with him could be 
					"he lost the mainland", "preserver of authentic Chinese culture", "he was a murderer",
					etc... After reading his biography, while (definitely) not agreeing with some of his 
					opinions or methods, I came away with a fresh understanding of what drove him. My view 
					of him remains mixed, which I shall try to expand upon here. 
				</p>
				<h3 id="early-years">Early Years</h3>
				<p>
					CKS was born in the Zhejiang province in eastern China, in 1887. At this point in time,
					China was still ruled by the Qing Dynasty, which had been a stagnating power for some time. 
					As fierce nationalist, during his early years he became closely involved with the 
					revolutionary movement of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Yat-sen">Sun Yat Sen</a>,
					which sought to establish a republic on China after deposing the Qing. After many failed
					attempts, the Qing were gone, and the Republic of China was established. In the 1920s, as 
					the ROC controlled mostly parts in southern China, with its capital at Guangdong, CKS 
					led a massive offensive to regain control of northern China called the Northern Expedition. 
					This established him as a competent general.
				</p>
				<h3 id="civil-War">The Civil War and Sino-Japanese War</h3>
				<p>
					The expulsion of the communist members from the KMT (Chinese Nationalist Party) is considered
					the beginning of the decades-long Chinese Civil War. At the same time, Japan was threatening
					to invade China and was already testing the ill prepared Chinese military in Manchuria,
					which the ROC claimed as their own. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Something I didn't know and found quite interesting was Stalin's involvement during this 
					time. Since he was afraid that Japan had intentions to invade the USSR, it was in his
					best interest to have a strong China hold off the Japanese. Thus he encouraged the CCP and
					the KMT to fight Japan together. The CCP, by Mao's instruction did not contribute much to 
					the effort. After more than 10 years of fighting Japan, and with millions of ROC troops dead,
					the civil war continued.

				</div>
				<p>
					At this moment, the CCP controlled Manchuria after the soviets briefly held it at the end of 
					WWII. One thing CKS would not budge on, being a nationalist, was the unity of China. Because
					of this, even when attacking Manchuria seemed a dire proposal, CKS continued to send troops
					into the area, which the newly created PLA managed to kill off. Without troops and with 
					massive inflation, he had been thinking to make a last stand on Taiwan, since it appeared
					to be defensible and it lacked the inflation rampant on the mainland. In 1949, he moved
					the remaining gold reserves and antiques,  along with many businessmen and government 
					officials.
				</p>
				<h3 id="Taiwan-era">The Taiwan Years</h3>
				<p>
					During this time, CKS maintained that there would be a triumphant return to the mainland,
					where the compatriots would be liberated. There was marshall law for several decades, 
					freedom of speech was restricted, and dissention was not highly tolerated, during a period
					called "The White Terror". However, although war with the new People's Republic seemed
					not too far away, the ROC on Taiwan underwent a rapid period of development, and along 
					with South Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore were known as 
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Asian_Tigers">The Four Asian Tigers</a>
					(although I personally prefer "The four small dragons", the Chinese pronounciation :( ).
				</p>
				<h3 id="conclusion">My takeaway</h3>
				<p>
					Talking about Chiang Kai-Shek is not easy. In Taiwan, he might be 
					regarded by many native groups (原住民) as an oppressor who instilled Chinese 
					culture on them and tried to erase their own culture. To others, he might be a preserver 
					of authentic Chinese culture. Since I did not grow up in Taiwan, I'm a bit 
					reluctant to take a stance, although I can definitely understand the reasoning
					behind his One-China ideology and his proudness of Chinese culture; witnessing
					that culture first hand made me also greatly appreciate that culture.  
				</p>
				<p>
					Taylor concludes that although the People's Republic controls the mainland, it was 
					in the end Chiang's vision of China that exists on both sides of the Strait.  The  
					implication seems to be that a respected, strong China might not have been possible
					under Mao's vision of a property-less state. 
				</p>
				<p>	
					Whatever the case may be, I am grateful that a place as lovely as Taiwan exists.
					Although the 228 incident, and the White Terror	remain in the public consciousness,
					it seems to me hard to imagine a Taiwan where those incidents happened: where people 
					not loyal to the party were rounded up, where there was a curfew for decades, where kids
					were discouraged to express their own native culture and language in school, etc...
					I'll personally continue to read more about this story, and if you have a chance, or any 
					interest, I would recommend this book as a starter!
