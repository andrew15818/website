# My personal site:

This is my repo for my first personal website. I am just doing this for fun, and
to get used to writiing HTML, CSS, and English! Since I do not currently know much
about web development, I am relying on Twitter Bootstrap to handle most of the 
formatting.

I plan to host this directly on Github Pages, so as to save on hosting costs. 
Github Pages does not allow for server-side scripts, but I think that at the 
moment I am far away from needing that, since I would like to practice basic
HTML and CSS. 

## What is this site?

I've wanted to have my own personal blog-ish type site for a while, both to 
have some sort of personal project and to get some  experience with basic
web development tools. 

## What will this site contain?

I'm still thinking what I could write about, but my ideas so far are:

1. Regular blog posts, maybe on a topic I've been thinking about, etc... 
2. Book reviews, recommendations: Since I like to read as a hobby,
I thought I might share whatever I've been reading recently and offer 
my opinion. If the writing is bad/unstructured, I'm sorry! I'm trying to
practice my writing and argument skills.

### Logo

I made my name with the funny colors using [manim](https://github.com/3bib/manim),
the Python library used by math Youtube channel 
[3Blue1Brown](https://youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw).
