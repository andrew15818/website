					<h4>Childhood</h4>
					<p>I was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honduras">Honduras</a>, a small country in Latin America, in 1998.From 2002-2016, through the 
					almost superhuman effort of my parents, was able to attend <a href="http://www.pinares.org/">Academia Los Pinares</a> in Tegucigalpa for all my 
					formative years. 
					</p>
					<p>
					Also since I was a little kid, my parents took me to soccer practice several 
					times a week from  kindergarten up to about third grade. After 4th grade, I 
					would practice with my classmates for the school team. This continued through 
					high school, where I would practice almost daily. We went to some national 
					tournaments but weren't really good enough to win anything haha.
					</p>
					<p>
					In school, I always loved (and still love) to read, and I'm always curious to
					learn about various different fields/areas. It helped spark an interest and 
					appetite for many different fields, and it's a habit I certainly hope to 
					permanently nurture.  
					</p>

					<h4>University</h4>
					<p>
					When I was in my last years of high school, there was a large pressure on all the students as to what and where they were to carry out their studies, as I'm 
					sure is the case around the world. Although I knew what I wanted to study, studying abroad seemed the only option for me to "make it", since jobs in Honduras 
					are not very abundant. After applying to the Taiwan scholarship, since my older brother was already here, I did not really have much hope, since the competition
					for it can be quite fierce. However, in July of 2016, an email came in requuesting the scholarship recipients show up to the Taiwanese Embassy in Tegucigalpa 
					that week. The next month was filled with preparing multpile documents and exams for my arrival and application procedures. 
					</p>
					<p>
					After arriving in Taipei and getting settled down, it was time to start learning Chinese, which I did for an entire year at National Taiwan Normal University.
					During that year, I also applied and was accepted to <a href= "https://www.nctu.edu.tw/">National Chiao Tung University</a> to study Computer Science,
					in which I currently am in my junior year. 
					The life at NCTU can be quite challenging, and once the semester opens, rarely is there a full night's sleep, but so far I am more than grateful for being in
					this wonderful country!
